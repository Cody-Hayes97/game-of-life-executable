# game-of-life-executable
The executable for game of life project built with pygame 

# How to Download
Simply click the main.exe file then click 'view raw' and it should download on your machine, then run the program. (this file is completely safe, I just couldnt think of a faster way to upload this executable so I threw it here on github)

# How to Run
Once you have downloaded the game, you will see a grid with a few buttons: START, STOP, RESET, SLOW, and FAST. simply click on as many of the squares, or **Cells** as youd like and click START to watch the algorithms run
